        <div class="project">
            <h3>Detecting microplastics in aquatic bodies using object detection model</h3>
            <p>Developed a YOLOv5-based model in Python to detect microplastics in aquatic environments with 93% accuracy, leveraging OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for data manipulation, and Pandas for analysis.Implemented real-time image and video capture using a microscope, enabling precise analysis and quantification of microplastic pollution in aquatic bodies, enhancing environmental monitoring capabilities. Utilized a comprehensive stack of OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and OS libraries to integrate advanced image processing and object detection functionalities, optimizing the model's performance in identifying microplastics in real-world aquatic scenarios.</p>
            </br>
            <h3>Driver Drowsiness Detection (IOT based)</h3>
            <p>Developed and deployed a driver drowsiness detection solution using Python, OpenCV, 
                and Keras on Raspberry Pi, achieving 95% accuracy in real-time assessment of driver 
                alertness through live video analysis. 
                Engineered an IoT-driven system to enhance driver safety by promptly detecting signs of 
                drowsiness, triggering alarms to mitigate potential fatigue-related incidents and ensure 
                proactive intervention. 
                Validated the effectiveness of the solution across diverse driving conditions, demonstrating 
                its robust performance and reliability in reducing risks associated with driver fatigue 
                through innovative edge computing and deep learning techniques.</p></br>
            <h3>AI Virtual Mouse</h3>
            <p>Developed an innovative virtual mouse system integrating MediaPipe Hands for real-time 
                live palm detection and PyAutoGUI for intuitive cursor control and click-and-drag 
                functionality. This system accurately tracked all hand landmarks, enabling precise cursor 
                movements and enhanced user interaction. 
                Achieved significant improvements in user experience and cursor control precision by 60% 
                through the seamless integration of computer vision and machine learning principles. By 
                leveraging MediaPipe Hands' capabilities, the system interpreted hand gestures in real
                time, translating them into responsive cursor actions with high accuracy. 
                Implemented advanced features such as voice-to-text and text-to-voice functionalities 
                using Google Translate libraries. These features were activated through specific hand 
                gestures, showcasing robust software integration skills and enhancing overall user 
                accessibility to the virtual mouse system. </p></br>
            <h3>Agricultural management</h3>
            <p>Utilized HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly 
                platform for effective financial planning, optimizing crop yield by showing prices of yields 
                in different locations, and leveraging XAMPP software to streamline the development 
                process. 
                The platform allows users to view product prices, photos, and videos, along with the 
                location of stores or farms, facilitating informed purchasing decisions and enhancing the 
                visibility and sales of local farmers and vendors by offering a comprehensive digital 
                marketplace. 
                This comprehensive digital marketplace ultimately improves financial planning and 
                decision-making for agricultural businesses by providing a platform for effective financial 
                planning, optimizing crop yield, and facilitating informed purchasing decisions.</p>
